# FPGA_MiCrobeDetection_WorkConfiguration
Microbe detection method based on FPGA environment configuration

##Desciption
Microbe detection methods based on NGS are showing advantages over traditional detection methods in many aspects such as analysis speed and detection universality. This work puts forward a easy way to make quick configuration for detection method based on FPGA

##Install
###Prerequisites
1. Linux OS, tested on CentOS release 6.5 (server) and Ubuntu 12.01 (Desktop)
2. FPGA Configuration

###Download and setup
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/FreezeFish/FPGA_MiCrobeDetection_WorkConfiguration.git` to download the shell scripts.
2. Run `cd FPGA_MiCrobeDetection_WorkConfiguration && . ./run.sh` to configure the environment and do the analysis.

##Files:
run.sh: Configure the environment and dispose the sample input files.<br>
